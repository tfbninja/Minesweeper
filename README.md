# Minesweeper
## Javafx Minesweeper game
*Executable Jar file coming soon....*
This emulates a normal minesweeper game, trigger a square with left-click, and flag with right-click. Flagging will disable the option to trigger a square until it is unflagged. A feature I added that I think is helpful, is a 3x3 box that surrounds the immediate area around your mouse making it easier to understand which squares each number corresponds to. If you find it annoying, toggle it with the 'BOX' button. If you lose, you can easily play again by hitting 'RESET', which will also re-randomize mine positions. 

If you can find it, there is an easter egg hidden in the game. It will be obvious once you find it.
