# Minesweeper
## Javafx Minesweeper game
*Executable Jar file coming soon....*
This plays your standard minesweeper game, with the added feature of a 3x3 box that surrounds the immediate area around your mouse making it easier to understand which squares each number corresponds to. If you find it annoying, toggle it with the 'BOX' button. If you lose, you can easily play again by hitting 'RESET', which will also re-randomize mine positions. 

If you can find it, there is an easter egg hidden in the game. It will be obvious once you find it.
